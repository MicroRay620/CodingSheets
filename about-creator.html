		<h2>
			History of <span class="bold">CodingCheats</span>
		</h2>

		<p> 
			The reason I made <span class="bold">CodingCheats</span> was to provide an easy and 
			accessible website for finding commands with a short summary on what that commands does.
			Which was made to allow coders to make a decision on what command to use if they can't decide
			on a command. I also made this website with the intention that everything will be free and
			have no trackers.
