			<p> 
				Hypertext Markup Lanaguage or <span class="bold">HTML</span> is a language used to 
				code websites (this website was even coded in HTML). HTML was invented in 1993. Files
				written in HTML use <span class="lantext">.html</span> file indicator.	This is
				one of the languages in the web 3 lanaguages. The other two are 
				<span class="lantext">Cascading Stylesheets</span> (or
				<span class="ib">CSS</span>) and <span class="lantext">JavaScript</span> 
				(which is also called <
				<br>
				<br> <span class="bold"> NOTE: MAJORITY OF THE COMMAND WILL HAVE 
				<span class="codetext"> &lt/&gt</span> CONTAINED IN IT!</span> Will say if a command
				is an exception to this rule. Every command (or <span class="italic">tag</span>)
				listed in this page will be written between <span class="codetext">&lthtml&gt</span>
				and <span class="codetext">&lt/html&gt</span>.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Key Terms
			</h2>
			<p>
				Before getting into the actual tags, let's get some terms defined that will be used.
			</p>
		
			<div class="tables">
				<ul>
					<li> 
						<span class="bold">Tags</span>
						<br> In coding, tags are what is put between <span class="commandtext">&lt</span>
						and <span class="commandtext">&gt</span>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Attributes</span>
						<br> Attributes are additions to tags. This can be have a word tied
						to a <span class="lantext">css</span> file or to a 
						<span class="lantext">js</span> file. It also can mean linking a word
						to a website url.  These will be discussed in [insert section name].
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		
			<h3>
				Structure Tags
			</h3>
		
			<p>
				Structure tags are used to define areas which other tags can appear on the page.
			</p>
		
			<div class="tables">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="codetext">&ltbody&gt</span> is used to define tags in the body
						portion of the page.
						<br> This tag is the most common out of the two tags.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="codetext">&ltfoot&gt</span> is used to define tags in the footer
						portion of the page. With it being uncommon to use, it can be used to have buttons
						in the bottom section of the page. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		
			<h4> 
				Text Tags
			</h4>
			<p> 
				With the structure tags being defined, lets move to the tags that can be used to have
				text contained in them. This list will include some tags that can be used to add 
				various changes to the text.
			</p>
			<div class="tables">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="codetext">&lth#&gt</span> is used to make header text. 
						<br> The <span class="bold">#</span> can be replaced by any number between 
						1 and 6.
					</li>
					<li> 
						<span class="codetext">&ltp&gt</span> is used to make standard text.
						The most common tag to find on any website for text. 
						<br> The <span class="bold">p</span> stands for
						<span class="italics">paragraph</span>.
					</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="codetext">&ltbr&gt</span> is used to add line break to
								your text (like in <span class="codetext">&ltp&gt</span>). 
								<br>
								<span class="bold">You won't have 
								<span class="codetext">&lt/br&gt</span> used in your document.
							</li>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">THE NEXT TAGS ARE OFTEN DONE
								IN A <a href="css-cheatsheet.html" class="link">CSS</a> FILE</span>
							</p>
							<li>
								<span class="codetext">&ltb&gt</span> is used to 
								<span class="italic">bold</span> text. 
							</li>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<span class="codetext">&ltstrong&gt</span> is also
										used to bold text. (Honestly, if it has 
										other uses to it, I do not know.
										Everytime I used 
										<span class="bold">&ltstrong&gt</span> I
										saw no difference between bold and strong.
									</li>
								</ul>
							<li>
								<span class="codetext">&lti&gt</span> is used to
								italize text.
							</li>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<span class="codetext">&ltem&gt</span> is also
										used to italize text (it is truly used for 
										empthasizing words, but I saw no diffference when 
										I used this tag [in 
										<a href="https://w3schools.com" class="link">w3schools</a>
						</ul>		
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h2>
				Head Tags
			</h2>
			<p>
				These tags are used to link documents with each other and add more to your 
				document. These use <span class="bold">attributes</span> to work. 
				<br>
				<br>
				All tags used here are between <span class="codetext">&lthead&gt</span>
				and <span class="codetext">&lt/head&gt</span>
				portion of the document (which is often right below below the 
				<span class="codetext">&lthtml&gt</span>). 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Additional Key Terms
			</h3>
			<p> 
				Before we get into the actual tags, lets define some key terms for this
				section.
			</p>
			<div class="tables">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Block-level</span>
						<br> Code that is using another file to define a command. An example
						would be like &ltspan&gt for using css in an html document.
						<br> <span class="bold">NOTE: USING THIS NEEDS A CSS OR JS
						FILE TO BE LINKED TO!
						</span> The ways to link those files will be explained in the 
						<span class="codetext">&ltlink&gt</span> tag below.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">In-line</span>
						<br> Code that is used for another language but is still in the
						same file (lke having <span class="lantext">css</span> in an
						<span class="codetext">html</span> file.)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h3>
				Head Text Tags 
			</h3>
			<p>
				These are tags used to input text that would appear in a spot on the page (like in 
				the Web Page tab.
			</p>
			<div class="tables">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="codetext">&lttitle&gt</span> is used to have text appear in
						the web browser tab.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h3>
				File Tags
			</h3>
			<p>

				<span class="bold">JavaScript</span> connected to/used in an html
				document.

			<div class="tables">
			<!-- Remove <span class="lantext"> on HTML -->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="codetext">&ltstyle&gt</span> is used to have 
						<span class="lantext">css</span> code in an html

					<li>
						<span class="codetext">&ltscript&gt</span> is used to have

					</li>
						<ul>

								<span class="codetext">&ltscript src="myjavascript.js"&gt
								&lt/script&gt</span>
								(<span class="bold">NOTE:

					<li>
						<span class="codetext">&ltlink&gt</span> is used to link a file to your
						<span class="lantext">html</span> file.
						<br>
						<span class="bold">You wouldn't use <span class="codetext">&lt/link&gt</span>
						at all for this.
					</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="commandtext"><span class="codetext">&ltlink</span> 
									type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"
									href="css/style.css"&gt</span> is used to link an external 
									<span class="lantext">css</span> file to your 
									<span class="lantext">html</span> file. You should have a
									seperate folder labeled <span class="italic">css</span>
									<br> <span class="bold">NOTE: in 
									<span class="commandtext">href="css/style.css"</span>, the
									<span class="commandtext">style.css</span> would be changed

				If you are just starting out with using HTML, I would recommend heading to 
				<a id="w3" href="https://w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> or taking a web programming
				course at your school (if it has it availalbe).
