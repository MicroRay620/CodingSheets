				Hypertext Markup Lanaguage or <span class="bold">HTML</span> is a language used to 
				code websites (this website was even coded in HTML). HTML was invented in 1993. Files
				written in HTML use <span class="lan">.html</span> file indicator.	This is
				one of the languages in the web 3 lanaguages. The other two are 
				<span class="lan">Cascading Stylesheets</span> (or
				<span class="ib">CSS</span>) and <span class="lan">JavaScript</span> 
				(which is also called <

				<br> <span class="bold"> NOTE: MAJORITY OF THE COMMAND WILL HAVE 
				<span class="code"> &lt/&gt</span> CONTAINED IN IT!</span> Will say if a command
				is an exception to this rule. Every command (or <span class="italic">tag</span>)
				listed in this page will be written between <span class="code">&lthtml&gt</span>
				and <span class="code">&lt/html&gt</span>.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Key Terms
			</h2>
			<p>
				Before getting into the actual tags, let's get some terms defined that will be used.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="tables">
			<ul>
				<li> 
					<span class="bold">Tags</span>
					<br> In coding, tags are what is put between <span class="command">&lt</span>
					and <span class="command">&gt</span>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="bold">Attributes</span>
					<br> Attributes are additions to tags. This can be have a word tied
					to a <span class="lan">css</span> file or to a 
					<span class="lan">js</span> file. It also can mean linking a word
					to a website url.  These will be discussed in [insert section name].
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="body">
		<h3>
			Structure Tags
		</h3>
		<p>
			Structure tags are used to define areas which other tags can appear on the page.
		</div>
		<div class="tables">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="code">&ltbody&gt</span> is used to define tags in the body
					portion of the page.
					<br> This tag is the most common out of the two tags.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="code">&ltfoot&gt</span> is used to define tags in the footer
					portion of the page. With it being uncommon to use, it can be used to have buttons
					in the bottom section of the page. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4> 
			Text Tags
		</h4>
		<p> 
			With the structure tags being defined, lets move to the tags that can be used to have
			text contained in them. This list will include some tags that can be used to add 
			various changes to the text.
		</p>
		<div class="tables">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="code">&lth#&gt</span> is used to make header text. 
					<br> The <span class="bold">#</span> can be replaced by any number between 
					1 and 6.
				</li>
				<li> 
					<span class="code">&ltp&gt</span> is used to make standard text.
					The most common tag to find on any website for text. 
					<br> The <span class="bold">p</span> stands for
					<span class="italics">paragraph</span>.
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="code">&ltbr&gt</span> is used to add line break to
							your text (like in <span class="code">&ltp&gt</span>). 
							<br>
							<span class="bold">You won't have 
							<span class="code">&lt/br&gt</span> used in your document.
						</li>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">THE NEXT TAGS ARE OFTEN DONE
							IN A <a href="css-cheatsheet.html" class="link">CSS</a> FILE</span>
						</p>
						<li>
							<span class="code">&ltb&gt</span> is used to 
							<span class="italic">bold</span> text. 
						</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="code">&ltstrong&gt</span> is also
									used to bold text. (Honestly, if it has 
									other uses to it, I do not know.
									Everytime I used 
									<span class="bold">&ltstrong&gt</span> I
									saw no difference between bold and strong.
								</li>
							</ul>
						<li>
							<span class="code">&lti&gt</span> is used to
							italize text.
						</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="code">&ltem&gt</span> is also
									used to italize text (it is truly used for 
									empthasizing words, but I saw no diffference when 
									I used this tag [in 
									<a href="https://w3schools.com" class="link">w3schools</a>
								</li>
					</ul>		
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4>
			Linking Tags
		</h4>
		<p>
			Linking tags are used to insert various things into the 
			document. This means inserting things like a an image or url.
		</p>
		<div class="tables">
			<ul>
				<li> 
					<span class="code">&lta&gt</span> is used
					to insert a clickable link to 
					an external file or a website url into your html document.
					<br> 
					If you do not want to have it be different from the other text
					or be modified, go to the <a href="css-cheatsheet.html" 
					class="link">css cheatsheet</a> for how to do that.
					<br>
					<br>
					To connect the this tag to the css file, you would have it as					
					<span class="command"><span class="code">&lta</span>
					href="website.com" class="name"&gt</span>. You can replace
					<span class="command">class</span> with 
					<span class="command">id</span>. 
					<br> You would also replace the <span class="bold">name</span>
					in </span class="command">class="name"</span> with whatever
					you want to name it.
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="command">
							<span class="code">&lta</span>
							href="website.com"<span class="code">&gt</span>
							</span> is the whole basic command
							used to insert a website url to your document. Of course
							the <span class="command">href="website.com</span>
							will have the <span class="command">website.com</span>
							replaced with the actual url link.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="command">
							<span class="codetext">&lta</span>
							href="file.html</span> is used to insert
							a link to a file. You would change the 
							<span class="command">file.html</span>
							in 
							<span class="command">href="file.html"</span>
							would be changed to the file you are linking. 
						</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h2>
			Head Tags
		</h2>
		<p>
			These tags are used to link documents with each other and add more to your 
			document. These use <span class="bold">attributes</span> to work. 
			<br>
			<br>
			All tags used here are between <span class="code">&lthead&gt</span>
			and <span class="code">&lt/head&gt</span>
			portion of the document (which is often right below below the 
			<span class="code">&lthtml&gt</span>). 
		</p>
		<h3>
			Additional Key Terms
		</h3>
		<p> 
			Before we get into the actual tags, lets define some key terms for this
			section.
		</p>
		<div class="tables">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="bold">Block-level</span>
					<br> Code that is using another file to define a command. An example
					would be like &ltspan&gt for using css in an html document.
					<br> <span class="bold">NOTE: USING THIS NEEDS A CSS OR JS
					FILE TO BE LINKED TO!
					</span> The ways to link those files will be explained in the 
					<span class="code">&ltlink&gt</span> tag below.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="bold">In-line</span>
					<br> Code that is used for another language but is still in the
					same file (lke having <span class="lan">css</span> in an
					<span class="code">html</span> file.)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>
			Head Text Tags 
		</h3>
		<p>
			These are tags used to input text that would appear in a spot on the page (like in 
			the Web Page tab.
		</p>
		<div class="tables">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="code">&lttitle&gt</span> is used to have text appear in
					the web browser tab.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>
			File [Head] Tags
		</h3>
		<p>

			<span class="bold">JavaScript</span> connected to/used in an html
			document.

		<!-- Remove <span class="lantext"> on HTML -->
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="code">&ltstyle&gt</span> is used to have 
					<span class="lan">css</span> code in an html

				<li>
					<span class="code">&ltlink&gt</span> is used to link a file to your
					<span class="lan">html</span> file.

					at all for this.
				</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="command"><span class="code">&ltlink</span> 
								type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"
								href="css/style.css"&gt</span> is used to link an external 
								<span class="lan">css</span> file to your 
								<span class="lan">html</span> file. You should have a
								seperate folder labeled <span class="italic">css</span>
								<br> <span class="bold">NOTE: in 
								<span class="command">href="css/style.css"</span>, the
