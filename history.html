			<h3>
				History of CodingSheets
			</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike what I have put in the "<span class="bold">Timeline</span>"
				portion of the page, this section is to give the reasoning and purpose
				of why I made CodingSheets.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Purpose and Motto Of CodingSheets
			</h3>
			<p>
				I made CodingSheets to help coders digure out what tag they are wanting to use
				when they have the idea for the purpose of the tag.
				<br> On top of that foundation, CodingSheets was made to also be free
				with no subscription (to be fair, I don't even see a reason for why 
				CodingSheets would have a subscription in the first place)/

		<h2>
			Alpha Stage
		</h2>
		<p>
			During this stage, the file changes won't be mentioned.
			Only because it really doesn't matter yet. Beta and Full Release, will have
			those changes listed.
