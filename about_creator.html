		<h2>History of <span class="bold">CodingCheats</span></h2>
		<p> The reason I made <span class="bold">CodingCheats</span> was to provide an easy and 
		accessible website for finding commands with a short summary of what those commands do.
		Which was made to allow coders to make a decision on what command to use if they can't decide
		on a command. I also made this website with the intention that everything would be free and
		have no trackers.</p>
